# Vulnerability-Scanning-Tool

## Overview

This is a Go-based Vulnerability Scanning Tool designed to identify common security vulnerabilities in web applications. It currently supports scanning for vulnerabilities such as:

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Directory Traversal

## Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Scans target URLs for multiple types of vulnerabilities.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to include new scanners.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generates a vulnerability report after scanning.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulnerability-scanning-tool.git
    cd vulnerability-scanning-tool
    ```

2. Install the required Go packages:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. Ensure that you have the necessary configurations set up in `config/config.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "Targets": [
            "http://example.com",
            "http://another-target.com"
        ],
        "Headers": {
            "User-Agent": "VulnerabilityScanner/1.0"
        },
        "ReportFormat": "txt"
    }
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the tool to scan the targets specified in `config/config.json`:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

2. After the scan completes, a report will be generated in the `scan_report.txt` file, detailing the vulnerabilities discovered.

### Example Output

Target: https://www.instagram.com?input=' OR '1'='1
  Type: SQL Injection
  Detected at: 2024-09-08T22:10:01+02:00
  Payload: ' OR '1'='1
  Suggestion: Sanitize and parameterize SQL queries to prevent injection attacks.


## Configuration

- **Targets**: The list of URLs to scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Headers**: Custom headers for making HTTP requests.
- **ReportFormat**: Specifies the report format (e.g., `txt`). Future formats like `json` can be added.

## Adding New Vulnerability Scanners

This tool uses a modular design. To add a new scanner, simply implement the `VulnerabilityScanner` interface and add your scanner to the list of scanners in `main.go`.

Example:

```go
type MyNewScanner struct{}

func (s *MyNewScanner) Scan(target string, headers map[string]string) (scanner.VulnerabilityDetails, bool) {
    // Implement your scanning logic here
}
```
