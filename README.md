# Vulnerability-Scanning-Tool
A tool that can detect common web vulnerabilities using Go, define scanning rules with a JSON-based DSL (Domain Specific Language), and integrate it into CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks.


# Set up I used for the project
Installed Go (Goland) from the official website. Verified the installetion by running 'go version' in the terminal.

Created a directory for the project.
Initialized a new Go module within the directory by running command 'go mod init <project directory name>'

Next step was to choose the IDE, and since I got used to the VSCode and used it for most of my projects, it was an easy choose

Defined a simple JSON-based configuration that allows users to configure what vulnerabilities to scan for. This DSL will serve as the input for the tool. The JSON file allows users to specify targets, vulnerabilities to scan for, custom headers, and report format.
